1. Add fine analog control to extrude motor speed:
	Potentiometer is connected to Arduino Mega 2560 pin A3.
	Input reads 0 when knob set to 1, reads 1023 when set to 10
	I will need to be able to tinker a little with the speed range for which the knob’s positions are mapped. It is a narrow range.

 
2. Add custom buttons to Pronterface:
	
	2.1 Load Clay Button
		Drives extrude motor fwd and stops after N number of preset steps.
		The place to stop is around Z +12mm of extrusion

	2.2 Unload Clay Button
		drives extrude motor in rev until extrude endstop is pressed. 
		This is Adruino Mega 2560 pin D40
		Input goes from 0 to 1 when endstop pressed.
 
	2.3 Nozzle Bath Button
		moves the printer’s XYZ into position over the magnetic nozzle bath, in the upper left of the build plate & then lowers it to +5mm
		a short sequence of g-code is executed on the MMM when this button is pressed. 
		in pseudocode it would be something like this:
			Home X, Y, Z;
			Elevate Z to 15 mm;
			Send X, Y to position over nozzle bath;
			Lower Z to +5mm over build plate; 
			I have found a good location for the nozzle bath, it is X0.00 mm , Y80.00 mm
